Node.js Application

This is a Node.js application that receives HTTP POST requests on the /track route, gets data in JSON format passed in the request body, and saves the data to a local file. If the data contains a count parameter, the application increments the value of the count key by the value of the count parameter in a Redis database.

The application also receives HTTP GET requests on the /count route, which returns the value of the count key from the Redis database.
